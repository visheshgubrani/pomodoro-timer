# pomodoro-timer

To create a pomodoro timer in HTML, JS, and CSS, you will need to do the following steps:

Create an HTML file that contains the basic structure of your web page. You will need some elements to display the timer,
the buttons to start, pause, and reset the timer, and some text to show the current status (work or break).
Create a CSS file that styles your HTML elements according to your preference. You can use colors, fonts, borders, margins, etc. to make your web page look nice and user-friendly.
Create a JS file that contains the logic of your pomodoro timer. You will need some variables to store the timer duration, the current time left, the current status, and the interval ID. You will also need some functions to start, pause, reset, and update the timer. You will use the setInterval and clearInterval methods to create and clear the timer interval. You will use the document.getElementById method to access and manipulate the HTML elements. You will use the innerHTML and style properties to change the text and color of the elements.
These are the main steps you need to follow to create a pomodoro timer in HTML, JS, and CSS. If you need more details or examples, you can check out some of these tutorials that explain each step in depth:
